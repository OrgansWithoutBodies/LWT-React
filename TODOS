IDEAS

- "Offline Mode"?
- json backup/restore
- "Local + Sync" backend?
- consider RxDB for electron-sqlite wrapper? https://github.com/nylas/electron-RxDB
- - would also need to consider making sure friendly w other plugins
- Tatoeba/Lute
- logging
- differentiate 'legacy' & 'extended'
- be able to have images in texts?
- auto read pdf (if has outline)
- Electron Mobile Mode
- parse text from web page url
- implementation as component prop?
- download audio from youtube
- term conjugation/declension/etc
- - term/baseTerm?
- routerbar?
